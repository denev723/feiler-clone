                <p>
                  1. The standard conditions shall apply solely between

                <p>
                  2. All deliveries and services of the seller shall be subject
                  to the following standard conditions of the German textile
                  industry. General Terms and Conditions of the purchaser shall
                  not be recognised by the seller, unless the seller has agreed
                  to their validity in writing. This also applies if the seller
                  unconditionally performs the services in the knowledge of
                  contrary or deviating conditions to the present Standard
                  Conditions.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 2 Place of performance, delivery and acceptance</h3>
                <p>
                  1. The place of performance for all aspects of the delivery
                  agreement shall be the place of the commercial business of the
                  seller.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. The goods shall be delivered from a domestic factory. These
                  shipping costs shall be borne by the purchaser. The purchaser
                  can determine the carrier. The goods shall be sent uninsured.
                  A delivery notice may be agreed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Packing costs for special packaging shall be borne by the

                  must be notified in advance. Unsorted shipments shall only be
                  permitted with the consent of the purchaser.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5. If acceptance is not made in time due to the fault of the
                  purchaser, the seller shall be entitled, at his discretion,
                  after a grace period of 12 calendar days has been set to
                  either submit an invoice for the goods with payment due
                  immediately (statement of accounts in arrears) or withdraw
                  from the contract or claim for damages.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 3 Place of venue</h3>
                <p>
                  The place of venue (also for litigation with respect to bills
                  and cheques) shall be, at the plaintiff's discretion, the
                  location of a German commercial establishment of one of the
                  parties or the address of the registered office for the
                  competent specialist or cartel organisation of the seller
                  (insert place). The court to which recourse is first sought
                  shall have jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 4 Subject matter of the contract</h3>
                <p>
                  1. The goods shall be delivered on specific dates (workday or
                  a specific calendar week). All sales shall only be concluded
                  for certain quantities, articles, levels of quality and fixed
                  prices. Both parties shall be bound by this. Commission
                  business will not be concluded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Block orders are permitted and must be limited when the
                  contract is concluded. The acceptance period shall not exceed
                  12 months.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 5 Interruption of Delivery</h3>
                <p>
                  1. In the event of force majeure, labour disputes a party is
                  not responsible for, and other operational disruptions that
                  are beyond a party’s control and have lasted or are expected
                  to last longer than a week, the delivery or acceptance period
                  shall readily be extended by the duration of the obstruction,
                  but not exceeding 5 weeks. The extension shall only be granted
                  if the other party is immediately made aware of the reason for
                  the obstruction, as soon as it is clear that the delivery or
                  acceptance deadline can not be met.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. If the delivery or acceptance in the cases referred to in
                  clause 1 does not take place within the extended delivery or
                  acceptance period the other party may withdraw from the
                  contract, after the expiry of a grace period of 12 calendar
                  days to be set.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Claims for damages shall be excluded in the cases referred
                  to in clause 1 if the relevant party has sufficiently
                  fulfilled their obligation in accordance with clause 1.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 6 Subsequent deadline for delivery</h3>
                <p>
                  1. After expiry of the delivery period, a grace period of 12
                  calendar days shall start without any declaration being
                  reqired. After this period, the purchaser may rescind the
                  contract by giving notice in writing. If the purchaser wishes
                  to request compensation for damages instead of delivery, it
                  must give the seller a 4-week grace period after expiry of the
                  agreed delivery date in writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. The grace period for goods in stock that are ready for
                  dispatch, and NOS goods - "Never-out-of-stock" - is 5 working
                  days. The purchaser must be informed immediately in the event
                  of non-delivery. Furthermore, the provisions of clause 1 shall
                  apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Before the end of the subsequent delivery deadline claims
                  of the purchaser for late delivery shall be excluded, if
                  section 8 clauses 2 and 3 do not apply.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 7 Notice of defect</h3>
                <p>
                  1. Notices for obvious defects shall be sent to the seller no
                  later than 12 calendar days after receipt of the goods. The
                  purchaser must report hidden defects to the purchaser without
                  delay upon discovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Any claim for defects shall be excluded after the supplied
                  goods have been cut or processed in any other way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Little, technically unavoidable deviations in quality,
                  colour, width, weight, finish or design may not be rejected.
                  This also applies for standard deviations, unless the seller
                  has declared in writing that the delivered goods must match
                  the sample.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. In case of justified complaints relating to obvious
                  defects, the purchaser has the right to request at the
                  seller’s discretion repair of the goods or delivery of
                  replacement goods within 12 calendar days after receipt of the
                  returned goods. In this case, the seller shall pay the freight
                  costs. If subsequent performance fails, the purchaser shall
                  only be entitled to reduce the purchase price or withdraw from
                  the contract, unless section 8 clauses 2 and 3 apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5. In the case of a hidden defect, the purchaser only has the
                  right to reduce the purchase price or withdraw from the
                  contract, unless section 8 clauses 2 and 3 apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6. If the notice of defect is not made in a timely manner, the
                  goods shall be deemed to be approved.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 8 Compensation for damages</h3>
                <p>
                  1. Claims for damages made by the purchaser shall be excluded
                  unless otherwise agreed in these conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. The exclusion in clause 1 shall not apply to liability in
                  accordance with the German Product Liability Act, in case of
                  intent, gross negligence on the part of the owners, legal
                  representatives and officers, fraud, failure to comply with a
                  provided guarantee, in the event of culpable injury to life,
                  body or health or in the event of a material breach of
                  contract by fault; material contractual duties are
                  obligations, the performance of which shapes the contract and
                  on which the purchaser may rely. A claim for compensation of
                  damages due to a breach of material contractual obligations
                  shall be limited to foreseeable damage typical for a contract
                  of this kind, unless another case referred to in clause 1
                  applies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. A change to the burden of proof to the detriment of the
                  purchaser is not connected with the above regulations.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 9 Payment</h3>
                <p>
                  1. The invoice shall be issued on the date of delivery or the
                  date of provision of the goods. Postponement of the due date
                  (valuation) is fundamentally excluded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Invoices are payable:<br />
                  - within 10 days of invoicing and dispatch of goods with 4%
                  express discount payment<br />
                  - from 11 to 30 days after invoicing and dispatch of goods
                  with 2.25% discount<br />
                  - from 31 to 60 days after invoicing and dispatch of goods
                  net.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the 61st day the purchaser shall be in default in
                  accordance with section 286 para. 2 No. 1 of the German Civil
                  Code (BGB).
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. If a bill of exchange is accepted by the seller in lieu of
                  cash, cheques or wire transfer then a surcharge of 1% of the
                  total will be charged with the acceptance of the bill of
                  exchange after the net target has expired as of the 61st day
                  from the date of invoice and shipment of goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. Instead of the above rules payment may be regulated as
                  follows, provided that the purchaser is bound to this for at
                  least 12 months:
                </p>

                </table>
                <p>
                  Clauses 1-3 shall apply accordingly when using this method for
                  regulating payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5. Changes to this procedure shall be announced three months
                  in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6. Payments will be used to pay the oldest debt due plus the
                  accrued interest on arrears.
                </p>
                <p>
                  7. The timeliness of payments is determined by the date the
                  payment is credited to the account of the seller.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 10 Payment after the due date<br /></h3>
                <p>
                  1. For payments made after the due date interest of 9
                  percentage points above the base rate shall be charged in
                  accordance with section 247 BGB (German Civil Code). Otherwise
                  section 288 BGB shall apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. The seller is not obligated to make any further deliveries
                  on the basis of the ongoing delivery contracts before complete
                  payment of invoice amounts due including interest is made. The
                  right to claim for damages caused by the delay is reserved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. In the event of substantial deterioration in the financial
                  circumstances, such as imminent insolvency or default of
                  payment, the seller can refuse his contractually agreed
                  services regarding all supply contracts that are based on the
                  same legal relationship agreed services or withdraw from this
                  delivery agreement after a grace period of 12 calendar days.
                  In addition section 321 BGB and section 119 of the Insolvency
                  Act shall remain unaffected.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 11 Off-setting and retention of payments</h3>
                <p>
                  Off-setting and retention of invoice amounts due shall only be
                  permitted with undisputed or legally established claims,
                  insofar as they do not refer to claims for damages that are
                  not closely related to a claim from the purchaser for
                  contractual performance without any defects.
                </p>
                <h3>§ 12 Retention of title</h3>
                <p>
                  1. The goods shall remain the property of the seller until
                  full payment of all receivables for the delivery of goods
                  arising from the business relationship, including ancillary
                  claims, damages as well as payment of cheques and bills of
                  exchange. The right of retention of title shall remain even if
                  individual claims by the seller are included in a current
                  invoice and the balance is drawn and recognised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. If the goods supplied under retention of title are combined
                  by the purchaser into a new movable, mixed or processed asset,
                  this shall be done for the seller, without him being liable as
                  a result. By combining, mixing or processing the goods, the
                  purchaser does not acquire ownership of the new item in
                  accordance with sections 947 ff. BGB. By combining, mixing or
                  processing items that do not belong to the seller, the seller
                  acquires ownership of the new item in proportion to the value
                  of his goods under retention of title in relation to the total
                  value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. If a centralised authority is invoked in the business
                  between the seller and purchaser, which assumes the risk
                  guarantee, the seller shall transfer ownership on dispatch of
                  the goods to the central authority subject to the condition of
                  payment of the purchase price by the central authority. The
                  purchaser will only be released from their payment obligation
                  upon payment by the central authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. The purchaser is entitled to resell or further process the
                  goods only under consideration of the following conditions:<br />
                  a) The purchaser may sell or process the goods under retention
                  of title in the ordinary course of business, provided that his
                  financial situation does not subsequently significantly
                  deteriorate.<br />
                  b) The purchaser hereby assigns any claim with all ancillary
                  rights arising from the resale of the goods under retention of
                  title - including any balance claims - to the seller. The
                  seller accepts this assignment.<br />
                  c) If the goods were combined, mixed or processed and the
                  seller has acquired joint ownership by the amount of the
                  invoiced value, then he shall be entitled to the purchase
                  price in proportion to the value of his rights to the
                  goods.<br />
                  d) If the purchaser sells the claim within the framework of
                  factoring, the purchaser will assign the claim against the
                  factor replacing the original claim to the seller and will
                  pass on its sales proceeds proportionately to the seller for
                  the value of the rights of the seller of the goods. The
                  purchaser is obliged to disclose the assignment to the factor
                  if it is more than 10 days past its due date with an invoice
                  or if his financial situation deteriorates significantly. The
                  seller accepts this assignment.<br />
                  e) The purchaser is authorised, provided it meets its payment
                  obligations to recover the assigned receivables. The right to
                  recover these claims shall expire in case of default of
                  payment by the purchaser or significant deterioration of the
                  assets of the purchaser. In this case the seller is authorised
                  by the purchaser to inform the customers of the assignment and
                  recover the receivables. To assert the assigned claims, the
                  purchaser shall provide the necessary information and permit
                  verification of the information. In particular, he shall
                  provide the seller with a detailed listing of all outstanding
                  claims with the names and addresses of customers, amount of
                  each claim, invoice date, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5. If the value of the existing security provided for the
                  seller exceeds the total amount of the seller’s claims by more
                  than 10%, then the seller shall be obligated at the
                  purchaser's request, to release securities at his discretion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6. Pledging or transferring ownership of the goods by way of
                  security or the assigned claims is inadmissible. The seller
                  should inform the creditor immediately of any seizures naming
                  the creditor of the seizure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  7. If the seller, in the exercise of its retention of title
                  requests the delivery item back, this shall not automatically
                  be deemed a withdrawal from the contract. The seller is free
                  to sell the returned goods subject to the retention of title
                  by private sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  8. The purchaser shall store the goods under retention of
                  title for the seller free of charge. He shall insure them
                  against standard risks, such as fire, theft and water within
                  the usual scope. The purchaser hereby assigns his claims to
                  the seller for damages from the above risks that he would be
                  entitled to from the with respect to insurance companies or
                  other obligated parties at the invoiced amount of the goods.
                  The seller accepts the assignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  9. All claims and rights arising from the retention of title
                  of all special forms defined in these conditions shall remain
                  until there is a complete release from contingent liabilities
                  (check-bill of exchange) that the seller has incurred in the
                  interest of the purchaser. The purchaser is in the case of
                  sentence 1 as a matter of principle allowed to carry out
                  factoring for his accounts receivables. However, he must
                  inform the seller before incurring contingent liabilities.
                </p>
