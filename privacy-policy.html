                  Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in

                  until the purpose for which it was collected no longer
                  applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or
                  revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be
                  deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for
                  storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law
                  retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take
                  place after these reasons cease to apply.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the
                  United States or other from a data protection perspective
                  non-secure non-EU countries. If these tools are active, your
                  personal data may potentially be transferred to these non-EU
                  countries and may be processed there. We must point out that
                  in these countries, a data protection level that is comparable
                  to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S.
                  enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to
                  the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have
                  any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it
                  cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret
                  Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your
                  personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control
                  over these processing activities.

                  A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only
                  subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any
                  time any consent you have already given us. This shall be

                  In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are
                  entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in
                  particular in the member state where they usually maintain
                  their domicile, place of work or at the place where the
                  alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in
                  effect regardless of any other administrative or court
                  proceedings available as legal recourses.

                  You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we
                  automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order
                  to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in

                  For security reasons and to protect the transmission of
                  confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you
                  submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either
                  an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an
                  encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of

                <p>
                  If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit

                  Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you
                  have the right to at any time demand information about your
                  archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as
                  the purpose of the processing of your data. You may also have
                  a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have
                  questions about this subject matter or any other questions
                  about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at

                  You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as
                  far as the processing of your personal data is concerned. To
                  do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand
                  restriction of processing applies in the following cases:

                    In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your

                    is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict
                    the processing of your personal data.

                  <li>
                    If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in

                    the right to demand the restriction of the processing of

                  <li>
                    If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR,

                    each other. As long as it has not been determined whose

                <p>
                  This website uses Sendinblue for the sending of newsletters.
                  The provider is the Sendinblue GmbH, Köpenicker Straße 126,
                  10179 Berlin, Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sendinblue services can, among other things, be used to
                  organize and analyze the sending of newsletters. The data you
                  enter for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter are
                  archived on Sendinblue’s servers in Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Data analysis by Sendinblue</strong><br />
                  Sendinblue enables us to analyze our newsletter campaigns. For
                  instance, it allows us to see whether a newsletter message has
                  been opened and, if so, which links may have been clicked.
                  This enables us to determine, which links drew an
                  extraordinary number of clicks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, we are also able to see whether once the e-mail was
                  opened or a link was clicked, any previously defined actions
                  were taken (conversion rate). This allows us to determine
                  whether you have made a purchase after clicking on the
                  newsletter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sendinblue also enables us to divide the subscribers to our
                  newsletter into various categories (i.e., to “cluster”
                  recipients). For instance, newsletter recipients can be
                  categorized based on age, gender, or place of residence. This
                  enables us to tailor our newsletter more effectively to the
                  needs of the respective target groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you do not want to permit an analysis by Sendinblue, you
                  must unsubscribe from the newsletter. We provide a link for
                  you to do this in every newsletter message. Moreover, you can
                  also unsubscribe from the newsletter right on the website.

                <h3>YouTube with expanded data protection integration</h3>
                <p>
                  Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website
                  operator is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House,
                  Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According
                  to YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any
                  information about visitors to this website before they watch
                  the video. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that
                  the sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled out as
                  a result of the expanded data protection mode. For instance,
                  regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will
                  always establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick
                  network.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website,
                  a connection to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a
                  result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our
                  pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube
                  account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to
                  directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal
                  profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of
                  your YouTube account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube
                  will be able to place various cookies on your device or
                  comparable technologies for recognition (e.g. device
                  fingerprinting). In this way YouTube will be able to obtain
                  information about this website’s visitors. Among other things,
                  this information will be used to generate video statistics
                  with the aim of improving the user friendliness of the site
                  and to prevent attempts to commit fraud.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under certain circumstances, additional data processing
                  transactions may be triggered after you have started to play a
                  YouTube video, which are beyond our control.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our
                  online content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art.
                  6(1)(f) GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If a
                  corresponding agreement has been requested, the processing
                  takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; the
                  agreement can be revoked at any time.

                <h3>Google Maps</h3>
                <p>
                  This website uses the mapping service Google Maps. The
                  provider is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House,
                  Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To enable the use of the Google Maps features, your IP address
                  must be stored. As a rule, this information is transferred to
                  one of Google’s servers in the United States, where it is
                  archived. The operator of this website has no control over the
                  data transfer. In case Google Maps has been activated, Google
                  has the option to use Google web fonts for the purpose of the
                  uniform depiction of fonts. When you access Google Maps, your
                  browser will load the required web fonts into your browser
                  cache, to correctly display text and fonts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We use Google Maps to present our online content in an
                  appealing manner and to make the locations disclosed on our
                  website easy to find. This constitutes a legitimate interest
                  as defined in Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If a respective declaration
                  of consent has been obtained, the data shall be processed
                  exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. This
                  declaration of consent may be revoked at any time.

                <h3>Job Applications</h3>
                <p>
                  We offer website visitors the opportunity to submit job
                  applications to us (e.g., via e-mail, via postal services on
                  by submitting the online job application form). Below, we will
                  brief you on the scope, purpose and use of the personal data
                  collected from you in conjunction with the application
                  process. We assure you that the collection, processing and use
                  of your data will occur in compliance with the applicable data
                  privacy rights and all other statutory provisions and that
                  your data will always be treated as strictly confidential.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Scope and purpose of the collection of data</strong
                  ><br />
                  If you submit a job application to us, we will process any
                  affiliated personal data (e.g., contact and communications
                  data, application documents, notes taken during job
                  interviews, etc.), if they are required to make a decision
                  concerning the establishment or an employment relationship.
                  The legal grounds for the aforementioned are § 26 New GDPR
                  according to German Law (Negotiation of an Employment
                  Relationship), Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (General Contract
                  Negotiations) and – provided you have given us your consent –
                  Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke any consent given at any
                  time. Within our company, your personal data will only be
                  shared with individuals who are involved in the processing of
                  your job application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If your job application should result in your recruitment, the
                  data you have submitted will be archived on the grounds of §
                  26 New GDPR and Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR for the purpose of
                  implementing the employment relationship in our data
                  processing system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Data Archiving Period</strong><br />
                  If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job
                  offer or withdraw your application, we reserve the right to
                  retain the data you have submitted on the basis of our
                  legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) for up to 6 months
                  from the end of the application procedure (rejection or
                  withdrawal of the application). Afterwards the data will be
                  deleted, and the physical application documents will be
                  destroyed. The storage serves in particular as evidence in the
                  event of a legal dispute. If it is evident that the data will
                  be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.g., due
                  to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only
                  take place when the purpose for further storage no longer
                  applies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Longer storage may also take place if you have given your
                  agreement (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) or if statutory data
                  retention requirements preclude the deletion.
